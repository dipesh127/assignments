    "#     The features of mongoDB are as follows:\n",
    "#         -Document model:\n",
    "#                 MongoDB has been designed with developer productivity and flexibility in mind. \n",
    "#             It is a document-oriented database, which means that data is stored as documents,\n",
    "#             and documents are grouped in collections. The document model is a lot more natural\n",
    "#             for developers to work with because documents are self-contained and can be treated\n",
    "#             as objects. This means that developers can focus on the data they need to store and\n",
    "#             process, rather than worrying about how to split the data across different rigid tables\n",
    "#         -Sharding:\n",
    "#                 Sharding is the process of splitting larger datasets across multiple distributed instances,\n",
    "#             or “shards.” When applied to particularly large datasets, sharding helps the database distribute\n",
    "#             and better execute what might otherwise be problematic and cumbersome queries. Without sharding,\n",
    "#             scaling a growing web application with millions of daily users is nearly impossible.\n",
    "#         -Replication:\n",
    "#                 When your data only resides in a single server, it is exposed to multiple potential points of \n",
    "#             failure, such as a server crash, service interruptions, or even good old hardware failure. Any\n",
    "#             of these events would make accessing your data nearly impossible.Replication allows you to sidestep\n",
    "#             these vulnerabilities by deploying multiple servers for disaster recovery and backup.\n",
    "#         -Authentication:\n",
    "#                 Authentication is a critical security feature in MongoDB. Authentication ensures that only authorized\n",
    "#             users can access the database. Without authentication, anyone can access your data.\n",
    "#         -Database Triggers:\n",
    "#                 Database triggers in MongoDB Atlas are a powerful feature that allow you to execute code when certain\n",
    "#             events occur in your database. For example, you can use triggers to execute a script when a document \n",
    "#             is inserted, updated, or deleted. Triggers can also be scheduled to execute at specific times.\n",
    "#         -Time Series Data:\n",
    "#                 Time series data is most commonly generated by a device, such as a sensor, that records data over time. \n",
    "#             The data is stored in a collection of documents, each of which contains a timestamp and a value. MongoDB\n",
    "#             provides a number of features to help you manage time series data.\n",
    "#         -Ad-Hoc Queries:\n",
    "#                 Time series data is most commonly generated by a device, such as a sensor, that records data over time. \n",

    "#         -Load Balancing:\n",

    "#             growing enterprise applications. Properly distributing millions of client requests to hundreds or thousands of servers\n",
